            <h2>Trading Algorithm</h2>
            <p>
            The performance data presented here is based on real trades executed by my trading algorithm, 
            which operates with actual capital in a live market environment. It connects directly to my 
            brokerage account, and its performance metrics are automatically updated each day.
            </p>
            <p>
            The algorithm’s performance is benchmarked against a leading stock index in the same market. 
            The comparison is based on a ‘buy-and-hold’ strategy, where the index’s stocks are held without trading.
